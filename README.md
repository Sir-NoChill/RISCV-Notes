# RISCV-Notes
An open repository for notes on the RISCV ISA
---
# Style Guidelines
- Be reasonable
- Colons are to go outside any environment (so for example, we do not write **BOLD:**, we write **BOLD**:)

# Commiting
Commits must be staged in their own branch and then a pull request must be created. Please regenerate the pdf file before creating the pull request.

# Roadmap
Through the term I am aiming to create a collection of reference documents that are nicer to look through than the slides or the textbook and that
condense what we need to know into less than 15 pages (subject to change) of material that we can reference for the core concepts and problems that
we will be asked to solve. 

More than simply being a set of compiled notes, I would like this to be a resource for future terms as well and maybe even the basis for a class
specific, open source textbook on the RISC-V specification. But that is a long ways away.

# The TODO list
Priority levels are from p1 (Important) to p4 (nice to have eventually).
Note that this is in addition to the todo's in the document itself.
- [ ] Add a nicer to read green sheet (p4)
- [ ] Complete the previous lecture sections (p1)
  - [ ] Pointers
  - [ ] Computer Arithmetic
  - [ ] Performance
  - [ ] Compiler Structure (Brief)
  - [ ] Exceptions and Interrupts
  - [ ] I/O
  - [ ] Computer Architecture
- [ ] Write verbose answers to the problem bank (p3)
- [ ] Add a more descriptive calling convention chart that includes the control and status conventions (p3)
- [ ] Write a more comprehensive set of appendices containing a references to useful links and websites for the class (p3)
- [ ] Write an explanation on how to test RISC-V code using rars and C
  - [ ] Add my example framework that I need to finish up
