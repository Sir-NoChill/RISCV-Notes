# Style Guidelines
- Be reasonable
- Colons are to go outside any environment (so for example, we do not write **BOLD:**, we write **BOLD**:)

# Commiting
Commits must be staged in their own branch and then a pull request must be created. Please regenerate the pdf file before creating the pull request.
